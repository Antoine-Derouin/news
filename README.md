## üí∏ Fund the Project

Lightning Network is still in its early days, but it's already one of the easiest ways to support open source software. Distribution and payments are pretty much monopolized, leaving developers vulnurable to deplatforming, not to mention the exorbitant fees they chagre. LN fixes the payment side and F-Droid fixes distribution. I believe it's a good combo for an Android app.
