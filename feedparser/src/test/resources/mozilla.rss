				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, Mozilla joins Fastly, Intel, and Microsoft in <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/press/calling-for-new-members">announcing the incorporation and expansion</a> of the <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/">Bytecode Alliance</a>, a cross-industry partnership to advance a vision for fast, secure, and simplified software development based on WebAssembly.</p>
<p>Building software today means grappling with a set of vexing trade-offs. If you want to build something big, it’s not realistic to build each component from scratch. But relying on a complex supply chain of components from other parties allows a defect anywhere in that chain to compromise the security and stability of the entire program. Tools like containers can provide some degree of isolation, but they add substantial overhead and are impractical to use at per-supplier granularity. And all of these dynamics entrench the advantages of big companies with the resources to carefully manage and audit their supply chains.</p>
<p>Mozilla helped create WebAssembly to allow the Web to grow beyond JavaScript and <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/13/webassembly-in-browsers/">run more kinds of software at faster speeds</a>. But as it matured, it became clear that WebAssembly’s technical properties — particularly memory isolation — also had the potential to transform software development beyond the browser by resolving the tension described above. Several other organizations shared this view, and we came together to <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/press/formation">launch the Bytecode Alliance as an informal industry partnership</a> in late 2019. As part of this launch, we <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/announcing-the-bytecode-alliance">articulated</a> our shared vision and called for others to join us in bringing it to life.</p>
<p>That vision resonated with others, and we soon heard from many more organizations interested in joining the Alliance. However, it was clear that our informal structure would not scale adequately, and so we asked prospective members to be patient and, in parallel with ongoing technical efforts, worked to incorporate the Alliance as a formal 501(c)(6) organization. That process is now complete, and we’re thrilled to welcome <a href="https://www.arm.com/">Arm</a>, <a href="https://dfinity.org/">DFINITY Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.embark-studios.com/">Embark Studios</a>, <a href="https://research.google.com/">Google</a>, <a href="https://shopify.engineering/">Shopify</a>, and <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">University of California at San Diego</a> as official members of the Bytecode Alliance. We aim to continue growing the Alliance in the coming months, and encourage other like-minded organizations to apply.</p>
<p>We have a real opportunity to change how software is built, and in doing so, enable small teams to build big things that are both secure and fast. Achieving the elusive trifecta — easy composition, defect isolation, and high performance — requires both the right technology and a coordinated effort across the ecosystem to deploy it in the right way. Mozilla believes that WebAssembly has the right technical ingredients to build a better, more secure Internet, and that the Bytecode Alliance has the vision and momentum to make it happen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12607" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/eric-rescorla-high-res-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/eric-rescorla-high-res-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/eric-rescorla-high-res-300x300.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/eric-rescorla-high-res.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />Now that we&#8217;re starting to get widespread COVID vaccination &#8220;vaccine passports&#8221; have started to become more relevant. The idea behind a vaccine passport is that you would have some kind of credential that you could use to prove that you had been vaccinated against COVID; various entities (airlines, clubs, employers, etc.) might require such a passport as proof of vaccination. Right now deployment of this kind of mechanism is fairly limited: Israel has one called the <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/Departments/General/corona-certificates">green pass</a> and the State of New York is using something called the <a href="https://epass.ny.gov/home">Excelsior Pass</a> based on some <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/digital-health-pass">IBM tech</a>.</p>
<p>Like just about everything surrounding COVID, there has been a huge amount of controversy around vaccine passports (see, for instance, this <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/vaccine-passports-stamp-inequity">EFF post</a>, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/theres-a-lot-that-can-go-wrong-with-vaccine-passports/">ACLU post</a>, or this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/travel/coronavirus-vaccine-passports.html">NYT article</a>).</p>
<p>There two seem to be four major sets of complaints:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requiring vaccination is inherently a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/florida-prohibits-vaccine-passports-citing-freedom/ar-BB1fftmF">threat to people&#8217;s freedom</a></li>
<li>Because vaccine distribution has been unfair, with a number of communities having trouble getting vaccines, a requirement to get vaccinated <a href="https://naturemicrobiologycommunity.nature.com/posts/how-vaccine-passports-will-worsen-inequities-in-global-health">increases inequity</a> and vaccine passports enable that.</li>
<li>Vaccine passports might be implemented in a way that is inaccessible for people without access to technology (especially to smartphones).</li>
<li>Vaccine passports might be implemented in a way that is a threat to user privacy and security.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&#8217;t have anything particularly new to say about the first two questions, which aren&#8217;t really about technology but rather about ethics and political science, so, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that helpful to weigh in on them, except to observe that vaccination requirements are nothing new: it&#8217;s routine to require children to be vaccinate to go to school, people to be vaccinated to enter certain countries, etc. That isn&#8217;t to say that this practice is without problems but merely that it&#8217;s already quite widespread, so we have a bunch of prior art here. On the other hand, the questions of how to design a vaccine passport system are squarely technical; the rest of this post will be about that.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-we-trying-to-accomplish%3F">What are we trying to accomplish?</h2>
<p>As usual, we want to start by asking what we&#8217;re trying to accomplish At a high level, we have a system in which a <em>vaccinated person</em> (VP) needs to demonstrate to some entity (the <em>Relying Party (RP)</em>) that they have been vaccinated within some relevant time period. This brings with it some security requirements&#8221;</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Unforgeability</em>: It should not be possible for an unvaccinated person to persuade the RP that they have been vaccinated.</li>
<li><em>Information minimization</em>: The RP should learn as little as possible about the VP, consistent with unforgeability.</li>
<li><em>Untraceability</em>: Nobody but the VP and RP should know which RPs the VP has proven their status to.</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to note at this point that there has been a huge amount of emphasis on the unforgeability property, but it&#8217;s fairly unclear &#8212; at least to me &#8212; how important it really is. We&#8217;ve had trivially forgeable paper-based vaccination records for years and I&#8217;m not aware of any evidence of widespread fraud. However, this seems to be something people are really concerned about &#8212; perhaps due to how polarized the questions of vaccination and masks have become &#8212; and we have already heard some reports of sales of fake vaccine cards, so perhaps we really do need to worry about cheating. It&#8217;s certainly true that people are talking about requiring proof of COVID vaccination in many more settings than, for instance, proof of measles vaccination, so there is somewhat more incentive to cheat. In any case, the privacy requirements are a real concern.</p>
<p>In addition, we have some functional requirements/desiderata:</p>
<ol>
<li>The system should be cheap to bring up and operate.</li>
<li>It should be easy for VPs to get whatever credential they need and to replace it if it is lost or destroyed.</li>
<li>VPs should not be required to have some sort of device (e.g., a smartphone).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-current-state">The Current State</h2>
<p>In the US, most people who are getting vaccinated are getting paper vaccination cards that look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/603805ceb643816fc1c010bb/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Covid-2021-GettyImages-1230165606-2.jpg" alt="COVID Vaccination Card" /></p>
<p>This card is a useful record that you&#8217;ve been vaccinated, with which vaccine, and when you have to come back, but it&#8217;s also trivially forgeable. Given that they&#8217;re made of paper with effectively no anti-counterfeiting measures (not even the ones that are in currency), it would be easy to make one yourself, and there are already people <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/18/scams-coronavirus-vaccination-cards/">selling them</a> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccination-cards-fake-scammers-fraud/">online</a>. As I said above, it&#8217;s not clear entirely how much we ought to worry about fraud, but if we do, these cards aren&#8217;t up to the task. In any case, they also have suboptimal information minimization properties: it&#8217;s not necessary to know how old you are or which vaccine you got in order to know whether you were vaccinated.</p>
<p>The cards are pretty good on the traceability front: nobody but you and the RP learns anything, and they&#8217;re cheap to make and use, without requiring any kind of device on the user&#8217;s side. They&#8217;re not that convenient if you lose them, but given how cheap they are to make, it&#8217;s not the worst thing in the world if the place you got vaccinated has to mail you a new one.</p>
<h2 id="improving-the-situation">Improving The Situation</h2>
<p>A good place to start is to ask how to improve the paper design to address the concerns above.</p>
<p>The data minimization issue is actually fairly easy to address: just don&#8217;t put unnecessary information on the card: as I said, there&#8217;s no reason to have your DOB or the vaccine type on the piece of paper you use for proof.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s actually not straightforward to remove your <em>name</em>. The reason for this is that the RP needs to be able to determine that the credential actually applies to you rather than to someone else. Even if we assume that the credential is tamper-resistant (see below), that doesn&#8217;t mean it belongs to you. There are really two main ways to address this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have the VP&#8217;s name (or some ID number) on the credential and require them to provide a biometric credential (i.e., a photo ID) that proves they are the right person.</li>
<li>Embed a biometric directly into the credential.</li>
</ol>
<p>This should all be fairly familiar because it&#8217;s exactly the same as other situations where you prove your identity. For instance, when you get on a plane, TSA or the airline reads your boarding pass, which has your name, and then uses your photo ID to compare that to your face and decide if it&#8217;s really you (this is option 1). By contrast, when you want to prove you are licensed to drive, you present a credential that has your biometrics directly embedded (i.e., a drivers license).</p>
<p>This leaves us with the question of how to make the credential tamper-resistant. There are two major approaches here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the credential physically tamper-resistant</li>
<li>Make the credential digitally tamper-resistant</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="physically-tamper-resistant-credentials">Physically Tamper-Resistant Credentials</h3>
<p>A physically tamper-resistant credential is just one which is hard to change or for unauthorized people to manufacture. This usually includes features like holograms, tamper-evident sealing (so that you can&#8217;t disassemble it without leaving traces) etc. Most of us have lot of experience with physically tamper-resistant credentials such as passports, drivers licenses, etc. These generally aren&#8217;t completely impossible to forge, but they&#8217;re designed to be somewhat difficult. From a threat model perspective, this is probably fine; after all we&#8217;re not trying to make it impossible to pretend to be vaccinated, just difficult enough that most people won&#8217;t try.</p>
<p>In principal, this kind of credential has excellent privacy because it&#8217;s read by a human RP rather than some machine. Of course, one could take a photo of it, but there&#8217;s no need to. As an analogy, if you go to a bar and show your driver&#8217;s license to prove you are over 21, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily create a digital record. Unfortunately for privacy, increasingly those kinds of previously analog admissions processes are actually done by scanning the credential (which usually has some machine readable data), thus significantly reducing the privacy benefit.</p>
<p>The main problem with a physically tamper-resistant credential is that it&#8217;s expensive to make and that by necessity you need to limit the number of people who can make it: if it&#8217;s cheap to buy the equipment to make the credential then it will also be cheap to forge. This is inconsistent with rapidly issuing credentials concurrently with vaccinating people: when I got vaccinated there were probably 25 staff checking people in and each one had a stack of cards. It&#8217;s hard to see how you would scale the production of tamper-resistant plastic cards to an operation like this, let alone to one that happens at doctors offices and pharmacies all over the country. It&#8217;s potentially possible that they could report people&#8217;s names to some central authority which then makes the cards, but even then we have scaling issues, especially if you want the cards to be available 2 weeks after vaccination. A related problem is that if you lose the card, it&#8217;s hard to replace because you have the same issuing problem.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref1" href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="digitally-tamper-resistant-credentials">Digitally Tamper-Resistant Credentials</h3>
<p>The major alternative here is to design a digitally tamper-resistant system. Effectively what this means is that the issuing authority <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature">digitally signs</a> a credential. This provides cryptographically strong authentication of the data in the credential in such a way that anyone can verify it as long as they have the right software. The credential just needs to contain the same information as would be on the paper credential: the fact that you were vaccinated (and potentially a validity date) plus either your name (so you can show your photo id) or your identity (so the RP can directly match it against you).</p>
<p>This design has a number of nice properties. First, it&#8217;s cheap to manufacture: you can do the signing on a smartphone app.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref2" href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> It doesn&#8217;t need any special machinery from the RP: you can encode the credential as a 2-D bar code which the VP can show on their phone or print out. And they can make as many copies as they want, just like your airline boarding pass.</p>
<p>The major drawback of this design is that it requires special software on the RP side to read the 2D bar code, verify the digital signature, and verify the result. However, this software is relatively straightforward to write and can run on any smartphone, using the camera to read the bar code.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref3" href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> So, while this is somewhat of a pain, it&#8217;s not that big a deal.</p>
<p>This design also has generally good privacy properties: the information encoded in credential is (or at least can be) the minimal set needed to validate that you are you and that you are vaccinated, and because the credential can be locally verified, there&#8217;s no central authority which learns where you go. Or, at least, it&#8217;s not <em>necessary</em> for there to be a central authority: nothing stops the RP from reporting that you were present back to some central location, but that&#8217;s just inherent in them getting your name and picture. As far as I know, there&#8217;s no way to prevent that, though if the credential just contains your picture rather than an identifier, it&#8217;s somewhat better (though the code itself is still unique, so you can be tracked) especially because the RP can always capture your picture anyway.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref4" href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>By this point you should be getting the impression that signed credentials are a pretty good design, and it&#8217;s no surprise that this seems to be the design that WHO has in mind for their <a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/interim-guidance-svc_20210319_final.pdf?sfvrsn=b95db77d_11&amp;download=true">smart vaccination certificate</a>. They seem to envision encoding quite a bit more information than is strictly required for a &#8220;yes/no&#8221; decision and then having a &#8220;selective disclosure&#8221; feature that would just have that information and can be encoded in a bar code.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-green-pass%2C-excelsior-pass%2C-etc%3F">What about Green Pass, Excelsior Pass, etc?</h2>
<p>So what are people actually rolling out in the field? The Israeli Green Pass seems to be basically this: a <a href="https://corona.health.gov.il/en/directives/biz-ramzor-app/">signed credential</a>. It&#8217;s got a QR code which you read with an app and the app then displays the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identification_number#Israel">ID number</a> and an expiration data. You then compare the ID number to the user&#8217;s ID to verify that they are the right person.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a lot of trouble figuring out what the Excelsior Pass does. Based on the NY Excelsior Pass <a href="https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/excelsior-pass-frequently-asked-questions/">FAQ</a>, which says that &#8220;you can print a paper Pass, take a screen shot of your Pass, or save it to the Excelsior Pass Wallet mobile app&#8221;, it sounds like it&#8217;s the same kind of thing as Green Pass, but that&#8217;s hardly definitive. I&#8217;ve been trying to get a copy of the specification for this technology and will report back if I manage to learn more.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-the-blockchain%3F">What About the Blockchain?</h2>
<p>Something that keeps coming up here is the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain</a> for vaccine passports. You&#8217;ll notice that my description above doesn&#8217;t have anything about the blockchain but, for instance, the Excelsior Pass says it is built on IBM&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/digital-health-pass">digital health pass</a> which is apparently <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/resources/healthcare/#section-3">&#8220;built on IBM blockchain technology&#8221;</a> and says &#8220;Protects user data so that it remains private when generating credentials. Blockchain and cryptography provide credentials that are tamper-proof and trusted.&#8221; As another example, in this <a href="https://www.lfph.io/cci/">webinar</a> on the Linux Foundation&#8217;s COVID-19 Credentials Initiative, Kaliya Young <a href="https://youtu.be/KZvbx5cRs9E?t=3153">answers a question on blockchain</a> by saying that the root keys for the signers would be stored in the blockchain.</p>
<p>To be honest, I find this all kind of puzzling; as far as I can tell there&#8217;s no useful role for the blockchain here. To oversimplify, the major purpose of a blockchain is to arrange for global consensus about some set of facts (for instance, the set of financial transactions that has happened) but that&#8217;s not necessary in this case: the structure of a vaccine credential is that some health authority <em>asserts</em> that a given person have been vaccinated. We do need relying parties to know the set of health authorities, but we have existing solutions for that (at a high level, you just build the root keys into the verifying apps).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref5" href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> If anyone has more details on why a blockchain<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> is useful for this application I&#8217;d be interested in hearing them.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-stuff-any-good%3F">Is this stuff any good?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell. As discussed above, some of these designs seem to be superficially sensible, but even if the overall design is sensible, there are lots of ways to implement it incorrectly. It&#8217;s quite concerning not to have published specifications for the exact structure of the credentials. Without having a detailed specification, it&#8217;s not possible to determine that it has the claimed security and privacy properties. The protocols that run the Web and the Internet are open which not only allows anyone to implement them, but also to verify their security and privacy properties. If we&#8217;re going to have vaccine passports, they should be open as well.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In early 2020, I <a href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2020/01/08/expanding-mozillas-boards-in-2020/">outlined our efforts to expand Mozilla’s boards</a>. Over the past year, we’ve added three new external Mozilla board members: <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/why-im-joining-the-mozilla-board/">Navrina Singh</a> and <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2021/02/18/why-im-joining-mozillas-board-of-directors/">Wambui Kinya</a> to the Mozilla Foundation board and <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2021/02/18/why-im-joining-mozillas-board-of-directors-2/">Laura Chambers</a> to the Mozilla Corporation board.</p>
<p>Today, I’m excited to welcome <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/msurman/">Mark Surman</a>, Executive Director of the Mozilla Foundation, to the Foundation board.  </p>
<p>As I said to staff prior to his appointment, when I think about who should hold the keys to Mozilla, Mark is high on that list. Mark has unique qualifications in terms of the overall direction of Mozilla, how our organizations interoperate, and if and how we create programs, structures or organizations.  Mark is joining the Mozilla Foundation board  as an individual based on these qualifications; we have not made the decision that the Executive Director is automatically a member of the Board.<br />
Mark has demonstrated his commitment to Mozilla as a whole, over and over. The whole of Mozilla figures into his strategic thinking. He’s got a good sense of how Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation can magnify or reduce the effectiveness of Mozilla overall. Mark has a hunger for Mozilla to grow in impact. He has demonstrated an ability to think big, and to dive into the work that is in front of us today. </p>
<p>For those of you who don’t know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/msurman/">Mark</a> already, he brings over two decades of experience leading projects and organizations focused on the public interest side of the internet. In the 12 years since Mark joined Mozilla, he has built the Foundation into a leading philanthropic and advocacy voice championing the health of the internet. Prior to Mozilla, Mark spent 15 years working on everything from a non-profit internet provider to an early open source content management system to a global network of community-run cybercafes. Currently, Mark spends most of his time on Mozilla&#8217;s efforts to promote trustworthy AI in the tech industry, a major focus of the Foundation&#8217;s current efforts.<br />
Please join me in welcoming Mark Surman to the Mozilla Foundation Board of Directors.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2021/04/20/wearing-more-mozilla-hats/">Mark’s message about why he’s joining Mozilla</a> here.</p>
<p>PS. As always, we continue to look for new members for both boards, with the goal of adding the skills, networks and diversity Mozilla will need to succeed in the future. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_12949" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MarkSurman_Headshot.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12949" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12949 size-full" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MarkSurman_Headshot.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="364" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-12949" class="wp-caption-text">Mark Surman</p></div>
<p>For many years now &#8212; and well before I sought out <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/leadership/#mark-surman">the job I have today</a> &#8212; I thought: the world needs more organizations like Mozilla. Given the state of the internet, it needs them now. And, it will likely need them for a very long time to come. </p>
<p>Why? In part because the internet was founded with public benefit in mind. And, as the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/details/">Mozilla Manifesto</a> declared back in 2007, “&#8230; (m)agnifying the public benefit aspects of the internet is an important goal, worthy of time, attention and commitment.” </p>
<p>Today, this sort of ‘time and attention’ is more important &#8212; and urgent &#8212;  than ever. We live in an era where the biggest companies in the world are internet companies. Much of what they have created is good, even delightful. Yet, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/04/the-internet-doesnt-have-to-be-awful/618079/">as the last few years have shown</a>, leaving things to commercial actors alone can leave the internet &#8212; and society &#8212; in a bit of a mess. We need organizations like Mozilla &#8212; and many more like it &#8212; if we are to find our way out of this mess. And we need these organizations to think big!</p>
<p>It’s for this reason that I’m excited to add another ‘hat’ to my work: I am <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2021/04/20/mark-surman-joins-the-mozilla-foundation-board-of-directors/">joining the Mozilla Foundation board today</a>. This is something I will take on in addition to my role as executive director.</p>
<p>Why am I assuming this additional role? I believe Mozilla can play a bigger role in the world than it does today. And, I also believe we can inspire and support the growth of more organizations that share Mozilla’s commitment to the public benefit side of the internet. Wearing a board member hat &#8212; and working with other Foundation and Corporation board members &#8212; I will be in a better position to turn more of my attention to Mozilla’s long term impact and sustainability. </p>
<p>What does this mean in practice? It means spending some of my time on big picture ‘Pan Mozilla’ questions. How can Mozilla connect to more startups, developers, designers and activists who are trying to build a better, more humane internet? What might Mozilla develop or do to support these people? How can we work with policy makers who are trying to write regulations to ensure the internet benefits the public interest? And, how do we shift our attention and resources outside of the US and Europe, where we have traditionally focused? While I don’t have answers to all these questions, I do know we urgently need to ask them &#8212; and that we need to do so in an expansive way that goes beyond the current scope of our operating organizations. That’s something I’ll be well positioned to do wearing my new board member hat. </p>
<p>Of course, I still have much to do wearing my executive director hat. <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Foundation">We set out a few years ago to evolve the Foundation into a ‘movement building arm’ for Mozilla</a>. Concretely, this has meant building up teams with skills in philanthropy and advocacy who can rally more people around the cause of a healthy internet. And, it has meant picking a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Foundation#Focusing_on_Trustworthy_AI_.28Strategy_Phase_II.2C_2019.29">topic to focus on: trustworthy AI</a>. Our movement building approach &#8212; and <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/12/15/mozillas-vision-for-trustworthy-ai/">our trustworthy AI agenda</a> &#8212; is getting traction. Yet, there is still a way to go to unlock the kind of sustained action and impact that we want. Leading the day to day side of this work remains my main focus at Mozilla. </p>
<p>As I said at the start of this post: I think the world will need organizations like Mozilla for a long time to come. As all corners of our lives become digital, we will increasingly need to stand firm for public interest principles like keeping the internet open and accessible to all. While we can all do this as individuals, we also need strong, long lasting organizations that can take this stand in many places and over many decades. Whatever hat I’m wearing, I continue to be deeply committed to building Mozilla into a vast, diverse and sustainable institution to do exactly this. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b><i>As technology makes massive shift to voice-enabled products, NVIDIA invests $1.5 million in Mozilla Common Voice to transform the voice recognition landscape </i></b></p>
<p>Over the next decade, speech is expected to become the primary way people interact with devices — from laptops and phones to digital assistants and retail kiosks. Today’s voice-enabled devices, however, are inaccessible to much of humanity because they cannot understand vast swaths of the world’s languages, accents, and speech patterns.</p>
<p>To help ensure that people everywhere benefit from this massive technological shift, Mozilla is partnering with NVIDIA, which is investing $1.5 million in Mozilla Common Voice, an ambitious, open-source initiative aimed at democratizing and diversifying voice technology development.</p>
<p>Most of the voice data currently used to train machine learning algorithms is held by a handful of major companies. This poses challenges for others seeking to develop high-quality speech recognition technologies, while also exacerbating the voice recognition divide between English speakers and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Launched in 2017, Common Voice aims to level the playing field while mitigating AI bias. It enables anyone to donate their voices to a free, publicly available database that startups, researchers, and developers can use to train voice-enabled apps, products, and services. Today, it represents the world’s largest multi-language public domain voice data set, with more than 9,000 hours of voice data in 60 different languages, including widely spoken languages and less used ones like Welsh and Kinyarwanda, which is spoken in Rwanda. More than 164,000 people worldwide have contributed to the project thus far.</p>
<p>This investment will accelerate the growth of Common Voice’s data set, engage more communities and volunteers in the project, and support the hiring of new staff.</p>
<p>To support the expansion, Common Voice will now operate under the umbrella of the Mozilla Foundation as part of its <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2021/02/10/next-steps-on-trustworthy-ai-transparency-bias-and-better-data-governance/">initiatives</a> focused on making artificial intelligence more trustworthy. According to the Foundation’s Executive Director, Mark Surman, Common Voice is poised to pioneer data donation as an effective tool the public can use to shape the future of technology for the better.</p>
<p>“Language is a powerful part of who we are, and people, not profit-making companies, are the right guardians of how language appears in our digital lives,” said Surman. “By making it easy to donate voice data, Common Voice empowers people to play a direct role in creating technology that helps rather than harms humanity. Mozilla and NVIDIA both see voice as a prime opportunity where people can take back control of technology and unlock its full potential.”</p>
<p>“The demand for conversational AI is growing, with chatbots and virtual assistants impacting nearly every industry,” said Kari Briski, senior director of accelerated computing product management at NVIDIA. “With Common Voice’s large and open datasets, we’re able to develop pre-trained models and offer them back to the community for free. Together, we’re working toward a shared goal of supporting and building communities — particularly for under-resourced and under-served languages.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>If we want the internet to be different we can’t keep following the same roadmap.</strong></p>
<p>I am celebrating a one-year anniversary at Mozilla this week, which is funny in a way, since I have been part of Mozilla since before it had a name. Mozilla is in my DNA&#8211;and some of my DNA is in Mozilla. Twenty-two years ago I wrote the open-source software licenses that still enable our vision, and throughout my years here I’ve worn many hats. But one year ago I became CEO for the second time, and I have to say up front that being CEO this time around is the hardest role I’ve held here. And perhaps the most rewarding.</p>
<p>On this anniversary, I want to open up about what it means to be the CEO of a mission-driven organization in 2021, with all the complications and potential that this era of the internet brings with it. Those of you who know me, know I am generally a private person. However, in a time of rapid change and tumult for our industry and the world, it feels right to share some of what this year has taught me.</p>
<p>Six lessons from my first year as CEO:</p>
<p><strong>1 AS CEO I STRADDLE TWO WORLDS:</strong> There has always been a tension at Mozilla, between creating products that reflect our values as completely as we can imagine, and products that fit consumers’ needs and what is possible in the current environment. At Mozilla, we feel the push and pull of competing in the market, while always seeking results from a mission perspective. As CEO, I find myself embodying this central tension.</p>
<p>It’s a tension that excites and energizes me. As co-founder and Chair, and Chief Lizard Wrangler of the Mozilla project before that, I have been the flag-bearer for Mozilla&#8217;s value system for many years. I see this as a role that extends beyond Mozilla&#8217;s employees. The CEO is responsible for all the employees, volunteers, products and launches and success of the company, while also being responsible for living up to the values that are at Mozilla’s core. Now, I once again wear both of these hats.</p>
<p>I have leaned on the open-source playbook to help me fulfill both of these obligations, attempting to wear one hat at a time, sometimes taking one off and donning the other in the middle of the same meeting. But I also find I am becoming more adept at seamlessly switching between the two, and I find that I can be intensely product oriented, while maintaining our mission as my true north.</p>
<p><strong>2 MOZILLA’S MISSION IS UNCHANGED BUT HOW WE GET THERE MUST:</strong> This extremely abnormal year, filled with violence, illness ,and struggle, has also confirmed something I already knew: that even amid so much flux, the DNA of Mozilla has not changed since we first formed the foundation out of the Netscape offices so many years ago. Yes, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/03/29/mozilla-marks-20th-anniversary-commitment-better-human-experiences-online/">we expanded our mission statement once to be more explicit about the human experience</a> as a more complete statement of our values.</p>
<p>What has changed is the world around us. And &#8212; to stick with the DNA metaphor for a second here &#8212; that has changed the epigenetics of Mozilla. In other words, it has changed the way our DNA is expressed.</p>
<p><strong>3 CHANGE REQUIRES FOLLOWING A NEW PATH:</strong> We want the internet to be different. We feel an urgency to create a new and better infrastructure for the digital world, to help people get the value of data in a privacy-forward way, and to connect entrepreneurs who also want a better internet.</p>
<p>By definition, if you’re trying to end up in a different place, you can’t keep following the same path. This is my working philosophy. Let me tell a quick story to illustrate what I mean.</p>
<p>Lately we’ve been thinking a lot about data, and what it means to be a privacy-focused company that brings the benefits of data to our users. This balancing act between privacy and convenience is, of course, not a new problem, but as I was thinking about the current ways it manifests, I was reminded of the early days of Firefox.</p>
<p>When we first launched Firefox, we took the view that data was bad — even performance metrics about Firefox that could help us understand how Firefox performs outside of our own test environments, we viewed as private data we didn&#8217;t want. Well, you see where this is going, don’t you? We quickly learned that without such data (which we call telemetry), we couldn’t make a well functioning browser. We needed information about when or why a site crashed, how long load times were, etc. And so we took one huge step with launching Firefox, and then we had to take a step sideways, to add in the sufficient &#8212; but no more than that! &#8212; data that would allow the product to be what users wanted.</p>
<p>In this story you can see how we approach the dual goals of Mozilla: to be true to our values, and to create products that enable people to have a healthier experience on the internet. We find ourselves taking a step sideways to reach a new path to meet the needs of our values, our community and our product.</p>
<p><strong>4 THE SUM OF OUR PARTS:</strong> Mozilla’s superpower is that our mission and our structure allow us to benefit from the aggregate strength that’s created by all our employees and volunteers and friends and users and supporters and customers.</p>
<p>We are more than the sum of our parts. This is my worldview, and one of the cornerstones of open-source philosophy. As CEO, one of my goals is to find new ways for Mozilla to connect with people who want to build a better internet. I know there are many people out there who share this vision, and a key goal of the coming era is finding ways to join or help communities that are also working toward a better internet.</p>
<p><strong>5 BRING ME AMBITIOUS IDEAS:</strong> I am always looking for good ideas, for big ideas, and I have found that as CEO, more people are willing to come to me with their huge ambitions. I relish it. These ideas don’t always come from employees, though many do. They also come from volunteers, from people outside the company entirely, from academics, friends, all sorts of people. They honor me and Mozilla by sharing these visions, and it’s important to me to keep that dialogue open.</p>
<p>I am learning that it can be jarring to have your CEO randomly stop by your desk for a chat &#8212; or in remote working land, to Slack someone unexpectedly &#8212; so there need to be boundaries in place, but having a group of people who I can trust to be real with me, to think creatively with me, is essential.</p>
<p>The pandemic has made this part of my year harder, since it has removed the serendipity of conversations in the break room or even chance encounters at conferences that sometimes lead to the next great adventure. But Mozilla has been better poised than most businesses to have an entirely remote year, given that our workforce was already between 40 and 50 percent distributed to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>6 WE SEEK TO BE AN EXAMPLE:</strong> One organization can’t change everything. At Mozilla, we dream of an internet and software ecosystem that is diverse and distributed, that uplifts and connects and enables visions for all, not just those companies or people with bottomless bank accounts. We can’t bring about this change single handedly, but we can try to change ourselves where we think we need improvement, and we can stand as an example of a different way to do things. That has always been what we wanted to do, and it remains one of our highest goals.</p>
<p>Above all, this year has reinforced for me that sometimes a deeply held mission requires massive wrenching change in order to be realized. I said last year that Mozilla was entering a new era that would require shifts. Our growing ambition for mission impact brings the will to make these changes, which are well underway.   From the earliest days of our organization, people have been drawn to us because Mozilla captures an aspiration for something better and the drive to actually make that something happen. I cannot overstate how inspiring it is to see the dedication of the Mozilla community.  I see it in our employees, I see it in our builders, I see it in our board members and our volunteers. I see it in all those who think of Mozilla and support our efforts to be more effective and have more impact. I wouldn’t be here without it. It’s the honor of my life to be in the thick of it with the Mozilla community. </p>
<p>&#8211; Mitchell</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an important victory for software developers, the Supreme Court ruled today that reimplementing an API is fair use under US copyright law. The Court’s reasoning should apply to all cases where developers reimplement an API, to enable interoperability, or to allow developers to use familiar commands. This resolves years of uncertainty, and will enable more competition and follow-on innovation in software.</p>

<p>This ruling arrives after more than ten years of litigation, including two trials and two appellate rulings from the Federal Circuit. Mozilla, together with other amici, filed several briefs throughout this time because <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2018/04/17/decision-in-oracle-v-google-fair-use-case-could-hinder-innovation-in-software-development/">we believed</a> the rulings were at odds with how software is developed, and could hinder the industry. Fortunately, in a 6-2 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/18-956_d18f.pdf">decision</a> authored by Justice Breyer, the Supreme Court overturned the Federal Circuit’s error.</p>
<p>When the case reached the Supreme Court, Mozilla filed an <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/files/2019/02/Mozilla-Google-v-Oracle-Amicus-Brief.pdf">amicus brief</a> arguing that APIs should not be copyrightable or, alternatively, reimplementation of APIs should be covered by fair use. The Court took the second of these options:</p>
<blockquote><p>We reach the conclusion that in this case, where Google reimplemented a user interface, taking only what was needed to allow users to put their accrued talents to work in a new and transformative program, Google’s copying of the Sun Java API was a fair use of that material as a matter of law.</p></blockquote>
<p>In reaching his conclusion, Justice Breyer noted that reimplementing an API “can further the development of computer programs.” This is because it enables programmers to use their knowledge and skills to build new software. The value of APIs is not so much in the creative content of the API itself (e.g. whether a particular API is “Java.lang.Math.max” or, as the Federal Circuit once suggested as an alternative, ““Java.lang.Arith.Larger”) but in the acquired experience of the developer community that uses it.</p>
<p>We are pleased that the Supreme Court has reached this decision and that copyright will no longer stand in the way of software developers reimplementing APIs in socially, technologically, and economically beneficial ways.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, Mozilla together with other internet companies ADT, Dropbox, Eventbrite, Reddit, Vimeo, Wikimedia, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Letter-to-the-FCC-to-reinstate-net-neutrality-March-2021.pdf">sent a letter to the FCC</a> asking the agency to reinstate net neutrality as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>For almost a decade, Mozilla has defended user access to the internet, in the US and <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/files/2020/08/Mexico-Net-Neutrality-Filing-031020-formatted_filed.pdf">around the world</a>. Our work to preserve net neutrality has been a critical part of that effort, including our <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/01/16/mozilla-files-suit-fcc-protect-net-neutrality/">lawsuit against the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to keep these protections in place for users in the US</a>.</p>
<p>With the recent appointment of Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel to lead the agency, there will be a new opportunity to establish net neutrality rules at the federal level in the near future, ensuring that families and businesses across the country can enjoy these fundamental rights.</p>
<p>Net neutrality preserves the environment that allowed the internet to become an engine for economic growth. In a marketplace where users frequently do not have access to more than one internet service provider (ISP), these rules ensure that data is treated equally across the network by gatekeepers. More specifically, net neutrality prevents ISPs from leveraging their market power to slow, block, or prioritize content&#8211;ensuring that users can freely access ideas and services without unnecessary roadblocks. Without these rules in place, ISPs can make it more difficult for new ideas or applications to succeed, potentially stifling innovation across the internet.</p>
<p>The need for net neutrality protections has become even more apparent during the pandemic. In a moment where classrooms and offices have moved online by necessity, it is critically important to have rules paired with strong government oversight and enforcement to protect families and businesses from predatory practices. In California, residents will have the benefit of these fundamental safeguards as a result of a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/23/net-neutrality-law-take-effect-california-after-judge-deals-blow-telecom-industry/">recent court decision</a> that will allow the state to enforce its state net neutrality law. However, we believe that users nationwide deserve the same ability to control their own online experiences.</p>
<p>While there are many challenges that need to be resolved to fix the internet, reinstating net neutrality is a crucial down payment on the much broader internet reform that we need. Net neutrality is good for people and for personal expression. It is good for business, for innovation, for our economic recovery. It is good for the internet. It has long <a href="https://www.publicconsultation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Net_Neutrality_Quaire_121217.pdf">enjoyed bipartisan support among the American public</a>. There is no reason to further delay its reinstatement once the FCC is in working order.</p>

<h1><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12607" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/eric-rescorla-high-res-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/eric-rescorla-high-res-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/eric-rescorla-high-res-300x300.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/eric-rescorla-high-res.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />Addressing Supply Chain Vulnerabilities</h1>
<p>One of the unsung achievements of modern software development is the degree to which it has become componentized: not that long ago, when you wanted to write a piece of software you had to write pretty much the whole thing using whatever tools were provided by the language you were writing in, maybe with a few specialized libraries like <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>. No longer. The combination of newer languages, Open Source development and easy-to-use package management systems like JavaScript&#8217;s <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> or Rust&#8217;s <a href="https://crates.io/">Cargo/crates.io</a> has revolutionized how people write software, making it standard practice to pull in third party libraries even for the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/left-pad">simplest tasks</a>; it&#8217;s not at all uncommon for programs to depend on hundreds or thousands of third party packages.</p>
<h1 id="supply-chain-attacks">Supply Chain Attacks </h1>
<p>While this new paradigm has revolutionized software development, it has also greatly increased the risk of supply chain attacks, in which an attacker compromises one of your dependencies and through that your software.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref1" href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> A famous example of this is provided by the 2018 <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/11/26/npm_repo_bitcoin_stealer/">compromise</a> of the <code>event-stream</code> package to steal Bitcoin from people&#8217;s computers. The Register&#8217;s brief history provides a sense of the scale of the problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ayrton Sparling, a computer science student at California State University, Fullerton (FallingSnow on GitHub), flagged the problem last week in a GitHub issues post. According to Sparling, a commit to the event-stream module added flatmap-stream as a dependency, which then included injection code targeting another package, ps-tree.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a number of ways in which an attacker might manage to inject malware into a package. In this case, what seems to have happened is that the original maintainer of event-stream was no longer working on it and someone else volunteered to take it over. Normally, that would be great, but here it seems that volunteer was malicious, so it&#8217;s not great.</p>
<h1 id="standards-for-critical-packages">Standards for Critical Packages </h1>
<p>Recently, Eric Brewer, Rob Pike, Abhishek Arya, Anne Bertucio and Kim Lewandowski posted a <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/02/know-prevent-fix-framework-for-shifting.html">proposal</a> on the Google security blog for addressing vulnerabilities in Open Source software. They cover a number of issues including vulnerability management and security of compilation, and there&#8217;s a lot of good stuff here, but the part that has received the most attention is the suggestion that certain packages should be designated &#8220;critical&#8221;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref2" href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For software that is critical to security, we need to agree on development processes that ensure sufficient review, avoid unilateral changes, and transparently lead to well-defined, verifiable official versions.</p></blockquote>
<p>These are good development practices, and ones we follow here at Mozilla, so I certainly encourage people to adopt them. However, trying to require them for critical software seems like it will have some problems.</p>
<h2 id="it-creates-friction-for-the-package-developer">It creates friction for the package developer </h2>
<p>One of the real benefits of this new model of software development is that it&#8217;s low friction: it&#8217;s easy to develop a library and make it available &#8212; you just write it put it up on a package repository like <a href="http://crates.io">crates.io</a> &#8212; and it&#8217;s easy to use those packages &#8212; you just add them to your build configuration. But then you&#8217;re successful and suddenly your package <em>is</em> widely used and gets deemed &#8220;critical&#8221; and now you have to put in place all kinds of new practices. It probably would be better if you did this, but what if you don&#8217;t? At this point your package is widely used &#8212; or it wouldn&#8217;t be critical &#8212; so what now?</p>
<h2 id="it's-not-enough">It&#8217;s not enough</h2>
<p>Even packages which are well maintained and have good development practices routinely have vulnerabilities. For example, Firefox recently released a new <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/85.0.1/releasenotes/">version</a> that fixed a <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2021-06/">vulnerability</a> in the popular <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle">ANGLE</a> graphics engine, which is maintained by Google. Both Mozilla and Google follow the practices that this blog post recommends, but it&#8217;s just the case that people make mistakes. To (possibly mis)quote <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/">Steve Bellovin</a>, &#8220;Software has bugs. Security-relevant software has security-relevant bugs&#8221;. So, while these practices are important to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities, we know they can&#8217;t eliminate them.</p>
<p>Of course this applies to inadvertant vulnerabilities, but what about malicious actors (though note that Brewer et al. observe that &#8220;Taking a step back, although supply-chain attacks are a risk, the vast majority of vulnerabilities are mundane and unintentional—honest errors made by well-intentioned developers.&#8221;)? It&#8217;s possible that some of their proposed changes (in particular forbidding anonymous authors) might have an impact here, but it&#8217;s really hard to see how this is actionable. What&#8217;s the standard for not being anonymous? That you have an e-mail address? A Web page? A <a href="https://www.dnb.com/duns-number.html">DUNS number</a>?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref3" href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> None of these seem particularly difficult for a dedicated attacker to fake and of course the more strict you make the requirements the more it&#8217;s a burden for the (vast majority) of legitimate developers.</p>
<p>I do want to acknowledge at this point that Brewer et al. clearly state that multiple layers of protection needed and that it&#8217;s necessary to have robust mechanisms for handling vulnerability defenses. I agree with all that, I&#8217;m just less certain about this particular piece.</p>
<h1 id="redefining-critical">Redefining Critical</h1>
<p>Part of the difficulty here is that there are ways in which a piece of software can be &#8220;critical&#8221;:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can do something which is inherently security sensitive (e.g., the OpenSSL SSL/TLS stack which is responsible for securing a huge fraction of Internet traffic).</li>
<li>It can be widely used (e.g., the Rust <a href="https://crates.io/crates/log">log</a>) crate, but not inherently that sensitive.</li>
</ul>
<p>The vast majority of packages &#8212; widely used or not &#8212; fall into the second category: they do something important but that isn&#8217;t security critical. Unfortunately, because of the way that software is generally built, this doesn&#8217;t matter: even when software is built out of a pile of small components, when they&#8217;re packaged up into a single program, each component has all the privileges that that program has. So, for instance, suppose you include a component for doing statistical calculations: if that component is compromised nothing stops it from opening up files on your disk and stealing your passwords or Bitcoins or whatever. This is true whether the compromise is due to an inadvertant vulnerability or malware injected into the package: a problem in any component compromises the whole system.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref4" href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> Indeed, minor non-security components make attractive targets because they may not have had as much scrutiny as high profile security components.</p>
<h1 id="least-privilege-in-practice%3A-better-sandboxing">Least Privilege in Practice: Better Sandboxing</h1>
<p>When looked at from this perspective, it&#8217;s clear that we have a technology problem: There&#8217;s no good reason for individual components to have this much power. Rather, they should only have the capabilities they need to do the job they are intended to to (the technical term is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">least privilege</a>); it&#8217;s just that the software tools we have don&#8217;t do a good job of providing this property. This is a situation which has long been recognized in complicated pieces of software like Web browsers, which employ a technique called &#8220;process sandboxing&#8221; (pioneered by Chrome) in which the code that interacts with the Web site is run in its own &#8220;sandbox&#8221; and has limited abilities to interact with your computer. When it wants to do something that it&#8217;s not allowed to do, it talks to the main Web browser code and asks it to do it for it, thus allowing that code to enforce the rules without being exposed to vulnerabilities in the rest of the browser.</p>
<p>Process sandboxing is an important and powerful tool, but it&#8217;s a heavyweight one; it&#8217;s not practical to separate out every subcomponent of a large program into its own process. The good news is that there are several recent technologies which do allow this kind of fine-grained sandboxing, both based on <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>. For WebAssembly programs, <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/11/announcing-the-bytecode-alliance/">nanoprocesses</a> allow individual components to run in their own sandbox with component-specific access control lists. More recently, we have been <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/02/securing-firefox-with-webassembly/">experimenting</a> with a technology called called <a href="https://rlbox.dev/">RLBox</a> developed by researchers at UCSD, UT Austin, and Stanford which allows regular programs such as Firefox to run sandboxed components. The basic idea behind both of these is the same: use static compilation techniques to ensure that the component is memory-safe (i.e., cannot reach outside of itself to touch other parts of the program) and then give it only the capabilities it needs to do its job.</p>
<p>Techniques like this point the way to a scalable technical approach for protecting yourself from third party components: each component is isolated in its own sandbox and comes with a list of the capabilities that it needs (often called a <em>manifest</em>) with the compiler enforcing that it has no other capabilities (this is not too dissimilar from &#8212; but much more granular than &#8212; the permissions that mobile applications request). This makes the problem of including a new component much simpler because you can just look at the capabilities it requests, without needing verify that the code itself is behaving correctly.</p>
<h1 id="making-auditing-easier">Making Auditing Easier</h1>
<p>While powerful, sandboxing itself &#8212; whether of the traditional process or WebAssembly variety &#8212; isn&#8217;t enough, for two reasons. First, the APIs that we have to work with aren&#8217;t sufficiently fine-grained. Consider the case of a component which is designed to let you open and process files on the disk; this necessarily needs to be able to open files, but what stops it from reading your Bitcoins instead of the files that the programmer wanted it to read? It might be possible to create a capability list that includes just reading certain files, but that&#8217;s not the API the operating system gives you, so now we need to invent something. There are a lot of cases like this, so things get complicated.</p>
<p>The second reason is that some components are critical because they perform critical functions. For instance, no matter how much you sandbox OpenSSL, you still have to worry about the fact that it&#8217;s handling your sensitive data, and so if compromised it might leak that. Fortunately, this class of critical components is smaller, but it&#8217;s non-zero.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that sandboxing isn&#8217;t useful, merely that it&#8217;s insufficient. What we need is multiple layers of protection<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref5" href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup>, with the first layer being procedural mechanisms to defend against code being compromised and the second layer being fine-grained sandboxing to contain the impact of compromise. As noted earlier, it seems problematic to put the burden of better processes on the developer of the component, especially when there are a large number of dependent projects, many of them very well funded.</p>
<p>Something we have been looking at internally at Mozilla is a way for those projects to tag the dependencies they use and depend on. The way that this would work is that each project would then be tagged with a set of other projects which used it (e.g., &#8220;Firefox uses this crate&#8221;). Then when you are considering using a component you could look to see who else uses it, which gives you some measure of confidence. Of course, you don&#8217;t know what sort of auditing those organizations do, but if you know that Project X is very security conscious and they use component Y, that should give you some level of confidence. This is really just a automating something that already happens informally: people judge components by who else uses them. There are some obvious extensions here, for instance labelling specific versions, having indications of what kind of auditing the depending project did, or allowing people to configure their build systems to automatically trust projects vouched for by some set of other projects and refuse to include unvouched projects, maintaining a database of insecure versions (this is something the Brewer et al. proposal suggests too). The advantage of this kind of approach is that it puts the burden on the people benefitting from a project, rather than having some widely used project suddenly subject to a whole pile of new requirements which they may not be interested in meeting. This work is still in the exploratory stages, so <a href="mailto:ekr-blog@mozilla.com">reach out to me</a> if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
<p>Obviously, this only works if people actually do <em>some</em> kind of due diligence prior to depending on a component. Here at Mozilla, we do that to some extent, though it&#8217;s not really practical to review every line of code in a giant package like <a href="https://webrtc.googlesource.com/src/">WebRTC</a> There is some hope here as well: because modern languages such as Rust or Go are memory safe, it&#8217;s much easier to convince yourself that certain behaviors are impossible &#8212; even if the program has a defect &#8212; which makes it easier to audit.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref6" href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> Here too it&#8217;s possible to have clear manifests that describe what capabilities the program needs and verify (after some work) that those are accurate.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary </h1>
<p>As I said at the beginning, Brewer et al. are definitely right to be worried about this kind of attack. It&#8217;s very convenient to be able to build on other people&#8217;s work, but the difficulty of ascertaining the quality of that work is an enormous problem<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref7" href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup>. Fortunately, we&#8217;re seeing a whole series of technological advancements that point the way to a solution without having to go back to the bad old days of writing everything yourself.</p>
