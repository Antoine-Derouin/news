---------------------

The first step is to find the app's
[_Application ID_](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id.html).
This is usually the same as the app's _Package Name_. You will find it
in files called _AndroidManifest.xml_ or _build.gradle_ most of the
time. You can also see it in the URLs for the app's page in various
app stores. Write it here:

#### APPLICATION ID: com.gowdaanish21.udemy_course_grabber

Below is a template "metadata file" to fill out, it has only the
required fields.  F-Droid uses this file to build and publish the app.
[Build Metadata Reference](https://f-droid.org/docs/Build_Metadata_Reference)
documents all available options. Add values after the colon


```yaml
# Categories (one per line, each starting with a space and a minus), chosen from the
# official list: https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/blob/master/stats/categories.txt
