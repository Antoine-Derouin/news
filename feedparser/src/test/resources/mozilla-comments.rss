				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Web literacy — the ability to read, write, and participate online — is one of the most important skills of the 21st century. We believe it should be enshrined as the fourth “R,” alongside Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. From our open source learning tools to our free educational curriculum, we are dedicated to empowering individuals by <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2016/04/08/introducing-mozillas-web-literacy-map-our-new-blueprint-for-teaching-people-about-the-web/">teaching Web literacy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lpfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/LPFI_PNF_presentation_CSTA_GoldenGate_chapter_6.18.15.pdf">In 2015</a>, 65% of California public schools offered no computer science courses at all. Public schools should do more to expose students to Web literacy: a paucity of funding and the elimination of digital skills classes and curriculum are a disservice to students and the state’s future.</p>
<p>On June 30, we submitted an <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/press/files/2016/07/Mozilla-Amicus-Letter-on-California-Quality-Education_June-30-2016.pdf"><i>amicus</i> letter</a> to the California Supreme Court urging review of the case <i>Campaign for Quality Education v. State of California</i>. The issue in this case is whether the California Constitution requires California to provide its public school students with a quality education. We wrote this letter because we believe that California students risk being left behind in our increasingly digitized society without a quality education that includes Web literacy skills.</p>
<p>The internet has become an integral part of life for many and continues to grow in its global impact. Empowering a Web literate generation of students is crucial to their success, that of the broader online ecosystem and to our local economy. Using technology is an important part of Web literacy but it is not all. Web literacy needs to include a deeper understanding of technology itself and of its impact to empower students and allow meaningful participation in their online lives.</p>
<p>We hope the California Supreme Court takes this case. Ultimately, a quality education, including Web literacy, unlocks opportunities for students to be more engaged citizens as well as making them more college and career ready in today’s technology-driven market.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many years people with visual impairments and the legally blind have paid a steep price to access the Web on Windows-based computers. The market-leading software for screen readers costs well over $1,000. The high price is a considerable obstacle to keeping the Web open and accessible to all. The <a href="http://www.nvaccess.org/">NVDA Project</a> has developed an open source screen reader that is free to download and to use, and which works well with Firefox. NVDA aligns with one of the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto’s</a> principles: “The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible.”</p>
<p>That’s why, at Mozilla, we have elected to give the project $15,000 in the inaugural round of our Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS) “<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS/Mission_Partners">Mission Partners</a>” awards. The award will help NVDA stay compatible with the Firefox browser and support a long-term relationship between our two organizations. NVDA is just one of eight grantees in a wide range of key disciplines and technology areas that we have chosen to support as part of the MOSS Mission Partners track. This track financially supports open source software projects doing work that meaningfully advances Mozilla’s <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/mission/">mission</a> and priorities.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qOQ7zELFmLE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3>Giving Money for Open Source Accessibility, Privacy, Security and More</h3>
<p>Aside from accessibility, security and privacy are common themes in this set of awards. We are supporting several secure communications tools, a web server which only works in secure mode, and a distributed, client-side, privacy-respecting search engine. The set is rounded out with awards to support the growing Rust ecosystem and promote open source options for the building of compelling games on the Web. (Yes, games. We consider games to be a key art-form in this modern era, which is why we are investing in the future of Web games with <a href="https://research.mozilla.org/webassembly/">WebAssembly</a> and <a href="https://games.mozilla.org/">Open Web Games</a>.)</p>
<p>MOSS is a continuing program. The Mission Partners track has a budget for 2016 of around US$1.25 million. The first set of awards listed below total US$385,000 and we look forward to supporting more projects in the coming months. Applications remain open both for <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS/Mission_Partners">Mission Partners</a> and for the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS/Foundational_Technology">Foundational Technology</a> track (for projects creating software that Mozilla already uses or deploys) on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>We are greatly helped in evaluating applications and making awards by the<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS#Selection_Committee"> MOSS Committee</a>. Many thanks again to them.</p>
<h3>And The Winners Are….</h3>

This award will permit face-to-face collaboration among the remote team and bring the software to beta status.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-9387" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nvaccess-252x48.png" alt="nvaccess" width="200" height="38" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nvaccess.org/">NVDA</a>: $15,000. NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA) is a free, open source screen reader for Microsoft Windows. This award will be used to make sure NVDA and Firefox continue to work well together as Firefox moves to a multi-process architecture.</p>
<p>This is only the beginning. Stay tuned for more award announcements as we allocate funds. Open Source is a movement that is only growing, both in numbers and in importance. Operating in the open makes for better security, better accessibility, better policy, better code and, ultimately, a better world. So if you know any projects whose work furthers the Mozilla Mission, send them our way and encourage them to apply.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2016/06/01/chairing-mozillas-board/">post</a> earlier this month, I mentioned the importance of building a network of people who can help us identify and recruit potential Board level contributors and senior advisors. We are also currently working to expand both the Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation Boards.</p>
<p><b>The role of a Mozilla Board member</b></p>
<p>I’ve written <a href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2012/07/25/mozilla-foundation-board-of-directors/">a few</a> <a href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2008/06/04/mozilla-corporation-board-of-directors">posts</a> about the role of the Board of Directors at Mozilla.</p>
<p>At Mozilla, we invite our Board members to be more involved with management, employees and volunteers than is generally the case. It’s not that common for Board members to have unstructured contacts with individuals or even sometimes the management team. The conventional thinking is that these types of relationships make it hard for the CEO to do his or her job. We feel differently. We have open flows of information in multiple channels. Part of building the world we want is to have built transparency and shared understandings.</p>
<p>We also prefer a reasonably extended “get to know each other” period for our Board members. Sometimes I hear people speak poorly of extended process, but I feel it’s very important for Mozilla.  Mozilla is an unusual organization. We’re a technology powerhouse with a broad Internet openness and empowerment mission at its core. We feel like a product organization to those from the nonprofit world; we feel like a non-profit organization to those from the Internet industry.</p>
<p>It’s important that our Board members understand the full breadth of Mozilla’s mission. It’s important that Mozilla Foundation Board members understand why we build consumer products, why it happens in the subsidiary and why they cannot micro-manage this work. It is equally important that Mozilla Corporation Board members understand why we engage in the open Internet activities of the Mozilla Foundation and why we seek to develop complementary programs and shared goals.</p>
<p>I want all our Board members to understand that “empowering people” encompasses “user communities” but is much broader for Mozilla. Mozilla should be a resource for the set of people who care about the open Internet. We want people to look to Mozilla because we are such an excellent resource for openness online, not because we hope to “leverage our community” to do something that benefits us.</p>
<p>These sort of distinctions can be rather abstract in practice. So knowing someone well enough to be comfortable about these takes a while. We have a couple of ways of doing this. First, we have extensive discussions with a wide range of people. Board candidates will meet the existing Board members, members of the management team, individual contributors and volunteers. We’ve been piloting ways to work with potential Board candidates in some way. We’ve done that with <a href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2012/07/25/cathy-davidson-joins-mozilla-foundation-board/">Cathy Davidson</a>, <a href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2014/05/22/ronaldo-lemos-joins-mozilla-foundation-board/">Ronaldo Lemos</a>, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2015/10/12/katharina-borchert-to-join-mozilla-leadership-team-as-chief-innovation-officer/">Katharina Borchert</a> and <a href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2016/02/01/dr-karim-lakhani-appointed-to-mozilla-corporation-board-of-directors/">Karim Lakhani</a>. We’re not sure we’ll be able to do it with everyone, and we don’t see it as a requirement. We do see this as a good way to get to know how someone thinks and works within the framework of the Mozilla mission. It helps us feel comfortable including someone at this senior level of stewardship.</p>
<p><b>What does a Mozilla Board member look like</b></p>
<p>Job descriptions often get long and wordy. We have those too but, for the search of new Board members, we’ve tried something else this time: a visual role description.</p>
<div id="attachment_9374" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9374" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-9374" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Board-Recruitment-MoCo-Board-Profile-1-600x338.jpg" alt="Board member job description for Mozilla Corporation" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Board-Recruitment-MoCo-Board-Profile-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Board-Recruitment-MoCo-Board-Profile-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Board-Recruitment-MoCo-Board-Profile-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Board-Recruitment-MoCo-Board-Profile-1.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9374" class="wp-caption-text">Board member job description for Mozilla Corporation</p></div>
<div id="attachment_9376" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9376" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-9376" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Board-Recruitment-MoFo-Board-Profile-1-600x338.jpg" alt="Board member job description for Mozilla Foundation" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Board-Recruitment-MoFo-Board-Profile-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Board-Recruitment-MoFo-Board-Profile-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Board-Recruitment-MoFo-Board-Profile-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Board-Recruitment-MoFo-Board-Profile-1.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9376" class="wp-caption-text">Board member job description for Mozilla Foundation</p></div>
<p>Here is a short explanation of how to read these visuals:</p>
<ul>
<li>The horizontal lines speaks to things that every Board member should have. For instance, to be a Board member, you have to care about the mission and you have to have some cultural sense of Mozilla, etc. They are a set of things that are important for each and every candidate. In addition, there is a set of things that are important for the Board as a whole. For instance, we could put international experience in there or whether the candidate is a public spokesperson. We want some of that but it is not necessary that every Board member has that.</li>
<li>In the vertical green columns, we have the particular skills and expertise that we are looking for at this point.</li>
<li>We would expect the horizontal lines not to change too much over time and the vertical lines to change depending on who joins the Board and who leaves.</li>
</ul>
<p>I invite you to look at these documents and provide input on them. If you have candidates that you believe would be good Board members, send them to the <a href="mailto:boarddevelopment@mozilla.com">boarddevelopment@mozilla.com</a> mailing list. We will use real discretion with the names you send us.</p>
<p>We’ll also be designing a process for how to broaden participation in the process beyond other Board members. We want to take advantage of the awareness and the cluefulness of the organization. That will be part of a future update.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Security of users is paramount. Technology companies need to do everything in their power to ensure the security of their users and build products and services with strong security measures in place to do that.</p>
<p>At Mozilla, it’s part of our <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/">mission</a> to safeguard the Web and to take a stand on issues that threaten the health of the Internet. People need to understand and engage with encryption as a core technology that keeps our everyday transactions and conversations secure. That’s why, just days before the Apple story broke, we launched an <a href="http://mzl.la/encrypt">awareness campaign</a> to educate users on the importance of encryption.</p>
<p><b>The Apple vs. FBI case</b></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve supported Apple since we first heard of the FBI request to Apple because this case is about user security and public safety.</p>
<p>The government is requiring Apple to create a flawed version of its software without key security features. The precedent this sets could drastically affect our users and every technology company. This can cause ripple effects across the industry to other technologies and companies.  And it would make it more likely that other governments would request the creation of this kind of flawed software. This situation is understandably emotionally-charged, but we don’t have the luxury of saying “just this one time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week, the FBI said in a brief that Apple purposefully created its products to be warrant-proof and that this fight is a marketing decision for Apple. The view that any company would design products with the goal of being “warrant proof” is ludicrous. Companies like Mozilla decide to create security features to protect users, keep the bad guys away and contribute to public safety, not to make their technology warrant proof. Unfortunately, making something that can be easily hacked by the FBI means making something that can be easily hacked by bad guys too.</p>
<p><b>Code is Speech</b></p>
<p>We also think that the FBI’s request raises serious concerns around the First Amendment and free speech. We said so in an <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MozillaAmicusBrief030316.pdf">amicus brief</a> we filed earlier this month with a coalition of technology companies. For many technology companies their code represents their view on security.  For Mozilla, as an open source company, because our code is made publicly available and guided by our <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Manifesto</a>, it is an essential way we express our views about security and many other issues.</p>
<p>One of the most important things about this case is that it has created mainstream discourse about some very important topics relevant to all our users &#8211; encryption, user security and government access to data. Encryption is an essential and ubiquitous security tool and weakening our security tools undermines everyday Internet users’ security.</p>
